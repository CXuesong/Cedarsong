# Cedarsong/Citations

Some citation scripts that can help you cite the sources from BlogClan. Might be handy for Wiki contributors.

Most of the scripts require you to have [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) plugin installed for your browsers. After installing the plugin, you can import the downloaded JS files into it via dashboard. After restarting your browser, the scripts should take effects.

If you come across any problems or suggestions, feel free to open an Issue for this repository with the name of script.
