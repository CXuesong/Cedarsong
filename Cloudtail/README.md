# Cedarsong/Cloudtail

A .NET Core project intended to track and report the changes happened on [en Warriors Wiki](http://warriors.wikia.com).

This project is also intended to test a series of Wiki-related repositories that lies beside this repos, including

*   [WikiClientLibrary](https://github.com/CXuesong/WikiClientLibrary)
*   [MwParserFromScratch](https://github.com/CXuesong/MwParserFromScratch)
*   [WikiDiffSummary](https://github.com/CXuesong/WikiDiffSummary)


Thanks to æ²™, who came up with this name of the project, perhaps because [Cloudtail](http://warriors.wikia.com/wiki/Cloudtail) is an excellent tracker.
